Lab 1
Lab 1 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the beginning of coding in our class. Being my first time ever coding it was stunning on how such code can print out our names. Seeing this at first really caught my eye and is very fascinating on how code could do a such a thing.

Lab 2
Lab 2 was another good one looking back at the code it seems so simple to create a little game out of it. At the time of the lab I had a lot of trouble with it. This sparked more of my interests in just how far code cold go when it comes to programming games.

Lab 8
I believe lab 8 was another good one as it implemented functions even though I have a lot of trouble with them. It is crazy how the code is able to calculate the judge average just by giving the computer the formula. The knowledge and speed a computer has is actually unreal.
